# decision-hold-lifecycle (renamed)

The separate decision concept was collapsed into the one primitive the captain cares about: a task held for the captain.
Read and follow `.agents/skills/captain-hold-lifecycle/SKILL.md`; it owns the completion gate, the recorded-answer rule, and every command this skill used to describe.
Where an older brief says `bin/fm-decision-hold.sh`, that command still works as a one-release compatibility shim over `bin/fm-captain-hold.sh`.
